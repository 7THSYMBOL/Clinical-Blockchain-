Clinical Health Data Exchange and Interoperability: When we talk about blockchain and healthcare, data exchange is typically the first topic to come up.

Blockchain-enabled health IT systems that can provide technological solutions to many challenges, including health data interoperability, integrity and security, portable user-owned data and other areas. Most fundamentally, blockchain could enable data exchange systems that are cryptographically secured and irrevocable.

This would enable seamless access to historic and real-time patient data, while eliminating the burden and cost of data reconciliation. The recent collaboration between Guardtime, the data-centric security company, and the Estonian eHealth Foundation to secure the health records of one million Estonian citizens using its proprietary Keyless Signature Infrastructure (KSI) is a classic example of blockchain technology.

However, considering the complexities around data ownership and governance structure for health data exchange between public and private entities, it would be difficult to replicate the Estonian blockchain-secured health records model globally.

Patient Trust Patients interact with a many of providers and medical organizations over their lifetime. Each interaction is accompanied by important, sensitive information that is grouped in the form of a medical record. However, managing access to this information can be cumbersome and not easily accessible by the patient, and given the rise of data breaches the information isn’t always secure.

In 2015, there were 112M health care record data breaches due to a hacking/IT incident.1 In 2016, it is estimated that one in three health care recipients will be a victim of a data breach.

Ecosystem collaboration Existing provider networks and health information exchanges tend to su er from a lack of coordination and transparency into all patient activities and measurable outcomes. As a result, providers typically have a fragmented view of the patient and struggle to articulate their value-based care worth to payers. The existing network structure and its generally inconsistent and lax audit processes also give rise to provider billing fraud, waste, and abuse. It is estimated that 5-10% of health care costs are fraudulent resulting from excessive billing or billing for nonperformed services.

Transaction processing and automation Regional and national payers are weighed down by complex, organically grown or custom con gured claims processing and adjudication engines that are required to process 4.6 million+ claims each day. 4 Breakdowns in any piece of the claims system can signi cantly delay processing times causing prompt payment penalties for the payer and inconsistent revenue cycles for the provider.

Authentic Care In the life sciences sector, pharmaceutical companies often struggle to track drugs through the development life cycle from clinical trials through global supply chains— resulting in a lack of traceability and transparency. Defeating factors resulted in 30% of drugs sold in developing countries being counterfeits.
